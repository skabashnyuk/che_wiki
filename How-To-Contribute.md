--------------
#### Report Bugs and Enhancements
* Download one of the latest milestone builds [called nightly](http://eclipse.org/che). Take it for a test drive before the final release and report any bugs you find in GitHub.
* [Report enhancements](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues). Got an idea for a killer feature? Or maybe something you use often could use some tweaking? Post an enhancement request!

#### Fix Bugs or Implement Enhancements
* Is there some bug that really bothers you? Instead of just reporting it, fix it.
* Hope on che-dev@eclipse.org or #eclipseche to discuss feature enhancements and the branching process.

#### Submit PRs for New Templates and Stacks
* We love having people add new stacks (environments for running projects) and sample projects.
* See our [CUSTOMIZING.md](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CUSTOMIZING.md#templates) for instructions.

#### Become a Committer
* Committers gain additional rights around managing the repositories and setting the release scope.
* Ongoing plug-in contributors are also welcome to be elevated as committers.

#### Promote Eclipse Che
* Let other people know that your application is [built on Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/artwork).
* Do you have a success story about Eclipse? Send us a story and we'll help you spread the word.
