Get Involved!
--------------
There are many ways to contribute to an open source project. Many people start with submitting bugs, but you can also give back by promoting Che and improving documentation.
All the way to contribute to Che is listed in the [README.md #contributing](https://github.com/eclipse/che#contributing) section.

For code contributions, you can refer to the main repo [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file where you will find all the sub git repository you may contribute to as well development flows with devfile.
