# Managing the Che community meetings

## Before a meeting

1. One week before the meeting, send out a reminder email to che-dev soliciting agenda items for agenda (include link to agenda doc)
2. Contact PM and tech leads to see if there are any topics they would like to propose
3. Look at Github for major features that have landed, or are in design & review phase, and contact the reporter to ask if they would like to discuss the topic on the meeting
4. Review list of Che community users and plan at least one Community Spotlight session per month - it's best to try to schedule out ~3 months, and mix OEMs, users, and active community developers for the Community Spotlight.  
5. Ensure that details for joining the meeting in the Che Dev Meetings wiki page are correct

## During a meeting

1. Join promptly on time!
2. Start recording before introducing the meeting
3. At the start of the meeting, say "welcome to the Che Community Meeting for $DATE"
4. Ensure that there is at least one person helping take notes from the meeting - the minutes are very valuable for those who did not attend
5. After the agenda items, ask for any other items or questions, and solicit agenda items for future meetings, before closing the meeting

## After the Che Dev Meeting

### Update the [Che Dev Meetings wiki page](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Che-Dev-Meetings)

1. Create a section for the most recent meeting
2. Include the plain text agenda items from the Google Doc in the Agenda section
3. Link to agenda and minutes in Google Docs
4. Create a copy of the previous Che Dev Meeting agenda, using a public Google account to allow sharing and editing outside of the enterprise organization, and link to it in the "Next meeting" section
5. Update the meeting date for the next meeting

### Managing meeting video

1. In the Bluejeans account used to run the meeting - access the recordings page
2. Make the recording globally viewable, and enable downloading
3. Download the video, and upload it to YouTube under the Che account
4. Add the meeting to the "Che meetings" playlist, change the title to "Che Community Meeting $DATE", and include the agenda in the description
5. In "Advanced settings" set the license to Creative Commons

### Post meeting minutes to mailing list

Write an email to che-dev including the agenda, a link to the agenda and notes, and a link to the video
