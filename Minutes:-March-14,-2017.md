## PRIMARY TOPICS

### 5.5.0 status 
We our on schedule to meet release 3/15/17. No concerns at this time.

### Blocker bugs
None after meeting.

### Intelligent Commands
Will not be released in 5.5.0. We need to create additional automation and make changes based on feedback we received from the closed beta. We will set a release date once the feedback and tests are completed.

### Deprecation Procedure  
Discussed how we would notify developers of upcoming deprecation. Plans to deprecate will be outlined in issues (where possible and appropriate) for community feedback. Once feedback has been addressed deprecation schedule will be announced on che-dev mailing list and in the changelog. In cases where the deprecation may affect white label customers, the team leads will notify Brad and James in advance so that those customers can be notified.
