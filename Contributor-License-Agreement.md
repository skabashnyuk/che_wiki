You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your PR will be merged. This a one-time requirement for Eclipse projects in GitHub. You can read more about what a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) is on on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. Signing the CLA might sound scary but it's actually very simple and can be done in less than a minute.

To sign the Eclipse CLA, [log in to the Eclipse projects forge](https://projects.eclipse.org/user/login/sso). You will need to create an account with the Eclipse Foundation. Click on "Contributor License Agreement", and complete the form. Be sure to use the same email address in your Eclipse account that you intend to use when you commit to Git.
