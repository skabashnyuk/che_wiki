2. Move community call minutes from CHE wiki ?
3. Put link to che community call inside the CHE product.

# DETAILED MINUTE:

### Communicating about the community call
- community meeting runs each second monday
- community meeting should have a permanent link
- we do record each meeting
- we will set up notification in different channels mail / twitter / MM

Actions:
- @slemeur create an issue to define the notification message for community call

### Move community call minutes from CHE wiki
Problems:
- We have a lot of wiki pages for the meeting minutes which creates navigation problem, if the reader is just using "Pages" panel

Proposals:
-  archive the old meeting minutes

Also discussed:
- keeping the old meetings can allow people to find interesting information by searching in the wiki
- there is no other place where we could move the meeting minutes

Actions:
- improve the homepage of che's wiki so that it better help the reader to navigate into the content of the wiki. 

### Put link to che community call inside CHE product.
Mario proposed to put link for the call right in IDE which is quite interesting because this way we will cover people that don't know about our twitter or not subscribed to che-dev mail list.
