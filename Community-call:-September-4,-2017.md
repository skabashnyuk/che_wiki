# TOPICS DISCUSSED:

1. Define how to communicate about the community call (Stevan)
2. Move community call minutes from CHE wiki ?
3. Put link to che community call inside the CHE product.

# DETAILED MINUTE:

### Communicating about the community call
- community meeting runs each second monday
- community meeting should have a permanent link
- we do record each meeting

Proposals:
- we prepare the agenda for the next community call - right after the end of the current one
we post an email + on MM the link to the meeting minutes + the link to the next agenda and invite people to propose their topics to the wiki (or by answering the email + asking in MM)
- Add a link for the call right in IDE which is quite interesting because this way we will cover people that don't know about our twitter or not subscribed to che-dev mail list.
- we will also include a link into the product to the MM channel (action for stevan)


Actions:
- @slemeur create an issue to add links to MM + community call inside the IDE

### Move community call minutes from CHE wiki
Problems:
- We have a lot of wiki pages for the meeting minutes which creates navigation problem, if the reader is just using "Pages" panel

Proposals:
-  archive the old meeting minutes

Also discussed:
- keeping the old meetings can allow people to find interesting information by searching in the wiki
- there is no other place where we could move the meeting minutes

Actions:
- improve the homepage of che's wiki so that it better help the reader to navigate into the content of the wiki. 

### Put link to che community call inside CHE product.
