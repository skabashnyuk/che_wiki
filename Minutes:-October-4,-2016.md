####3. OpenShift Plugin Status
Has some services that are not created. We are unsure who system(Che or RH) is not functioning properly. We are currently working with RH to get OpenShift plugin working. 

####4. Intelligent Commands.
Can the server run the intelligent commands in workspace machines as apposed to running directly from workspace machine. This would help with intelligent command portability to other workspaces. To do this it is proposed that context from the workspace be sent to server for execution.

Move commands into palette.
