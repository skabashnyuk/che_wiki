### Milestone Status Queries
TODO @bmicklea

## Issue Triage
New issues are processed and assigned a label for follow-up by the Triage owner. A new Issue Triage owner is assigned each week.

The Issue Triage query contains 
- all open issues or pull requests that...
- are unlabelled, or are non-blocker bugs...
- and have no one assigned...
- and aren’t labeled with a team/... label.

For each issue in the list, the Triage owner processes it depending on its type:
- Invalid issues > close them and explain the reason.
- General questions > label them with “kind/question”.
- Docs issues > label with “kind/docs”.
- Enhancement requests > label them with “kind/enhancement” and add a team/... label (the team owner can remove the team label if they don’t plan on working on the enhancement at that time).
- Technical tasks and to-dos > label them with “kind/task” and add a team/... label (the team owner can remove the team label if they don’t plan on working on the enhancement at that time).
- Blocker bugs > add a comment mentioning the team lead you feel should know and/or @riuvshin.

Technical issues assigned to a team (via the team/... labels) that do not have a status/... label are considered unprocessed (you can find unprocessed issues queries in the common queries section of this page). To complete them the Team Lead (or optionally Triage owner) must:
- Assign it the appropriate status/ label and optionally add sprint/current-sprint label and add it to the milestone.
- Edit the title to improve it (if needed).
- Follow-up with the author (if needed). 

Team Leads should keep their unprocessed backlog as small as possible at all times and try to move issues as quickly as possible to "status/open-for-dev".

## Sprint Management

## Filing Bugs

## Duplicates
Duplicate bugs are closed with a comment `duplicates #issue`. Please try to reference an earlier issue unless a later issue is more appropriate (has more context, better scenarios, repro steps, etc.).
