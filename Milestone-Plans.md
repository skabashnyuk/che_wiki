For past milestones, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

As part of our 6-9 month roadmap, we are restructuring the underlying workspace model to support workspaces with multiple machines, dynamically deployed agents to make base images lighter, virtual file system so editors and IDEs can be notified of changes made by other clients, a new Chefile capability which provides a Vagrant-style workflow for Che workspaces, and consolidated support for an underlying database model.

##5.2.0 (latest)
_Milestone Details:_ https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/3976

_Primary Goals_

- Docker Compose Support in Chefiles: Multi-machine workspaces automatically generated from your repo.

- Improved CLI Output: More detail has been added to the info command plus you can generate a diagnostic snapshot for problems.
- CPU Limiting for Docker Builds: Docker builds can be CPU intensive so they now carry CPU limits to prevent starving other workspaces.
- Restart a Failed Workspace: You can now easily restart workspaces that didnâ€™t start correctly the first time.
- Python Intellisense: Syntax highlighting and hover-over help docs.
