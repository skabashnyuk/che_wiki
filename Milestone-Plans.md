We perform a release at the end of every milestone. Our milestones follow our sprint process which is a three week agile sprint starting on a Wednesday and finishing on Tuesday three weeks later. We keep master pristine and always releasable, and only PRs that have passed quality control are mergeable. We make releases at the end of the milestone whether development teams have merged PRs or not. Essentially, the train leaves the station on a regular time.
