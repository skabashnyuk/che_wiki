# PRIMARY TOPICS

## Secretary process for the community meeting minutes 
The purpose of the secretary process is to:
- collect the topics to be discussed
- have the result of the meetings published to the community

We defined the following:
- The secretary sends a gdoc to collect the topics for the next session, every attendees can drop his topic
- The secretary take notes of the meeting minutes in the gdoc
- Once the session is done, the meeting minutes are published on Che's wiki

The secretary role is rotating accross the attendees of the meeting - following the alphabetical order of the lastname.

## Milestone information
Community can get information about released milestones by using the milestone tag from github. 
Community can follow the work that is in-progress and planned by using the following labels:
- sprint/current-sprint: the work actually in progress
- sprint/next-sprint: for the work that is going to be planned for the next sprint

At the end of each sprint, we usually do a release. We will publish the links to the milestone information for each release.

## Definition of maintainers
We have been discussing about re-inforcing the role and responsibilities of maintainers of Che repository.
The goal of the discussion was to define a process in order to provide a better response to the PR that are proposed by the community. We would like to improve the process so that there is an initial triage which is done, but we also want to ensure that a response is given in less than 48h to a pull request. The sooner the feedbacks are provided to a PR, the easier it would be to get the PR requirements completed, merged and delivered to the community.

A proposal will be made by Project Leaders during this week.
