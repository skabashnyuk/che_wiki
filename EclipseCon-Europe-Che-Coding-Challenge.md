Complete a simple coding challenge in the language of your choice using Eclipse Che to be in with a chance of winning one of the Chromebooks being used on the booth.

We have prepared a developer workspace in four languages (C, Go, Python, and Java). Your task is to open a developer workspace in the language of your choice, by clicking the link below. If you do not have an account, you will be asked to create one for http://che.openshift.io

* Python: https://che.openshift.io/f?name=fizzbuzz-python&user=dneary
* C: https://che.openshift.io/f?name=fizzbuzz-c&user=dneary
* Java: https://che.openshift.io/f?name=fizzbuzz-java&user=dneary
* Go: https://che.openshift.io/f?name=fizzbuzz-golang&user=dneary

Once you have provisioned your workspace, you will need to modify the relevant source file in the project to complete the challenge.

For those who are unfamiliar with FizzBuzz, it is a children's game, played by a group who arrange themselves in a circle. One child starts counting at 1, and the next child increments the count, replacing any multiple of 3 with "Fizz", and any multiple of 5 with "Buzz". Multiples of 15 are replaced with both words, "FizzBuzz", giving the game its name. These programs print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive according to the rules of this game.
