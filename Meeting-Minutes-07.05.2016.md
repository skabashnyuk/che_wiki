######IMPORTANT POINTS ON TOPICS DISCUSSED:  
​
​
**0. Pre-Ship / Post-Ship for 4.3 / 4.4**

They were not all solved in time due to certain circumstances:
- support for redhat dev nation (Eugene, Brad)
- support for 4.4 release
- eclipse democamp (Stevan)

Now the situation has been handled.  

**1. Status for 4.5 Release**  
​
Dashboard has been cleanup. Bugs have been reviewed and scope narrowed. ​Target cleared.  
4.5 : release date planned for 12 July  
  
4.5 will introduce the new URL, so we'll need to go trough all the various references in the docs for Che and Codenvy.


**2. Scope for 4.6**

- Stacks/Templates not ready
- New console tabs
- UI for new list in dashboard
- move to github issues

**3. Discuss management of public issues**

An issue template has been added to Che repository/ we'll do the same for Codenvy repo.

A new sprint will start on August 3rd. First sprint that should be done entirely on github. We'll move all issues to github and follow new processes. We'll scope 4.6 and move all the issues from Jira.

A clear definitions about labels + milestone will be documented and discussed.

**4. Reformatting all executions of che to always be container-based.**

A discussion occurred about how to simplify the overall setup of Che and upgrade cycle. One of the potential solution would be to support a single server mode, when it runs inside of a Che container.
