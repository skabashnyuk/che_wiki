This roadmap acts as a 6-9 month forward-looking expectation of what we are working to incorporate into Eclipse Che. This roadmap is thematic tied to our three core audiences: a) users (developers), b) customizers (ISVs), and c) deployers (enterprises / teams). We schedule release milestones on a functionality basis with 2-3 milestones scheduled in advance. The length of a milestone is unknown, but we attempt to keep it less than a month and sometimes as short as 2 weeks. We map the epics implemented from the roadmap into each milestone. The epics and features that roll into a milestone are determined by pull request readiness of the feature at the time a milestone begins. In other words, we only place into a milestone features that are code complete and waiting for master-integration and testing.

## Users: Simplify the Getting Started Experience
Eclipse Che should install anywhere and be easy to install. It should also be possible for you to get a project-typed workspace with a custom set of commands in a natural, minimal sequence. Eclipse Che should become context-aware and auto-generate workspaces with type and code information based upon the contents of directory or repository.
