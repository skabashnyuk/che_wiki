### 5.4.0 status 
In progress, release anticipated for 3/1/17. No concerns at this time.

### Blocker bugs
Reviewed all blockers, downgraded one to P1 status as it was really a request for further diagnostic tooling. The other blockers are being addressed in the current sprint.

Will start beta review on 3/1/17 with members of the community. The feature will be evaluated in its current branch (not merged to master yet).
