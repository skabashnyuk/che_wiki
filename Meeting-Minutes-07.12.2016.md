**4. Discuss management of public issues**

We have discussed the list of proposed labels.  

Next sprint pre-planning will occur with jira filters. Once the sprint will be scoped, we will move the issues off of jira and put them on github. That should happen beginning of next week.  

The goal is to make 4.6 the first iteration done entirely on github.
