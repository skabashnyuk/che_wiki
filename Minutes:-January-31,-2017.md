##IMPORTANT POINTS ON TOPICS DISCUSSED:

#### 1. 5.2.0 status  
On schedule to be released by end of sprint schedule tomorrow.

#### 2. PR requirements  
We discussed new PR required guidelines as described at [https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#pull-requests](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#pull-requests). 

PR will only get milestone designated to them. Issue will no longer have milestone but only `sprint/current-sprint` and `severity` labels to identify them to potentially being part of a milestone release. `severity/blocker` labels should be used to identify issues that milestone release cannot be released without. 

TL will be responsible for reviewing their teams PR and making sure that the guidelines are followed per [https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#pull-requests](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#pull-requests).
