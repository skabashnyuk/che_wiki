We track support tickets, issues and feature requests using the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/eclipse/che).

Before Submitting an Issue
--------------------------
Check that [the issues page](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues)
does not already include that problem or suggestion. Do this before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments. These comments only
clutter the discussion, and do not help resolving it. Yet, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have extra information that may help, 
please leave a comment.

Writing Great Issues and Suggestions
------------------------------------
Please file a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not file combination issues.

The more information you provide, the more likely reproducing the issue and finding a fix will be. 

Thus:
* Provide reproducible steps, the results of the steps, and what you would have expected.
* A detailed description of the behavior that you expect.
* Animated GIFs are a tremendous help.
* Version information of Eclipse Che and Docker.
* Error outputs that may exist in your browser console.

Do not feel bad if we cannot reproduce the issue and ask for more information.

Finally, this is [our issue tracking](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Issue-Tracking) workflow. This describes what happens once you submit an issue.
