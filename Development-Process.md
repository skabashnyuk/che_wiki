Eclipse Che has generational advances (A.x.x), major releases with features (x.A.x), and bug fix releases (x.x.A). Each release is associated with a milestone target. We develop in two week agile iterations with a milestone release attempted at the end of each sprint.

# Roadmap
The team has a 6 month high level [Roadmap]() which defines the themes, features and technical debt to be addressed in the timeframe.

# Milestones
We will work in two-week iterations on the items in the roadmap. We begin a milestone on a Thursday and end on a Wednesday. The target is to make a published milestone release at the end of each iteration cycle. We start iterations mid-week to allow for the possibility to have the release process flow into the following iteration and still complete within the same calendar week where the iteration completed.

At the end of each iteration, we want to have a version of Che that can be used by the Che community. The project leaders will decide if a milestone release within GitHub becomes a marketing "ship" event, where we have completed the Eclipse IP process and do a broad-based marketing update with the release notes.  

The work done in a milestone is captured in the milestone plan (see [Milestone Plans]()). The feature highlights, bugs fixed, and technical debt tasks completed are all contained in the release notes.
